# save-the-ball
After getting inspired from a famous game , I created this game with the help of simple libraries like turtle,random.This is a game, in which the user should make sure that the
ball will not touch the arrow provided.If it touches,game over and anyone cant play the game further.It will give survived time and points message in the interface.
